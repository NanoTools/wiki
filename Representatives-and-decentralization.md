RaiBlocks gives users direct control over network decentralization.  

In the infrequent case where the network needs to make a global decision, your wallet software performs a balance-weighted vote to determine the outcome.  Since not everyone can remain online and perform this duty, your wallet names a representative that can vote with, but cannot spend, your balance.

For groups wishing to set up their own representatives nodes where people can name you as their representative, take the following things in to consideration.
* Your hardware and internet connection should be reliable  
* CPU, memory, and bandwidth will not be significantly impacted  
* Your representative account does not need to have a balance.

We encourage people who run web wallets, exchanges, or other services that use RaiBlocks to run a representative which will contribute to the health of the network.
